# Java-5-card-draw
Text based program that simulates a 5 card draw game

I made this program with the original purpose to make an activity to teach my advanced high school programming classes.

Card.java make a single card that has a suit, value (String), and a numerical value

Deck.java uses the Card class to make a deck of 52 cards. Can create multiple decks if needed.
You can shuffle the deck and "draw from the top".

Hand.java takes a deck and integer value to create a player's hand (5 cards)
There is a default constructor that is used for testing purposes. 
Within this class you can show your hand, discard, and draw from deck.

Main.java contains the game itself and the methods that check for the various winning combinations.

To do:
implement a scoring system.
